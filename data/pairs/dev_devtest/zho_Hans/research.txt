完成的工作大多是理论性的，但编写程序的目的，是为了模拟对人马座星系的观测。	The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
该团队正在寻找的效应可能是由星系暗物质和银河系暗物质之间的潮汐力引起的。	The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
就像月球对地球施加拉力，引起潮汐一样，银河系也对人马座星系施加着作用力。	Just like the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
科学家们可以得出结论，暗物质对其他暗物质的影响方式与普通物质相同。	The scientists were able to conclude that the dark matter affect other dark matter in the same way regular matter does.
该理论认为，一个星系周围的大多数暗物质都处在星系周围的某种光环中，由许多小粒子组成。	This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of lots of small particles.
