收敛思维模式是通过结合不同的想法或领域来寻找解决方案的问题解决技巧。	Convergent thinking patterns are problem solving techniques that unite different ideas or fields to find a solution.
这种思维模式看重的是速度、逻辑和准确性，还有甄别事实、对现有技术的重新应用和信息收集。	The focus of this mindset is speed, logic and accuracy, also identification of facts, reapplying existing techniques, gathering information.
这种思维模式最重要的因素是：正确答案只有一个。你只需考虑两个答案，即对的或者是错的。	The most important factor of this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You only think of two answers, namely right or wrong.
这种思维模式与某些科学或标准程序不无关联。	This type of thinking is associated with certain science or standard procedures.
这种思维类型的人具有逻辑思维，能够记得住模式、解决问题，还能进行科学测试。	People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
到目前为止，人类是最善于读懂他人心思的物种。	Humans are by far the most talented species in reading the minds of others.
这意味着我们能够成功地预测其他人的感知、意图、信仰、知识或欲望。	That means we are able to successfully predict what other humans perceive, intend, believe, know or desire.
在这些能力中，理解他人意图至关重要。我们可以凭借这一能力理解身体行为可能表达出的模棱两可的问题。	Among these abilities, understanding the intention of others is crucial. It allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions.
例如，如果你看到有人打破车窗，你很有可能会认为这个人在偷陌生人的汽车。	For example, if you were to see someone breaking a car window, you would probably assume he was trying to steal a stranger’s car.
如果他是丢了车钥匙，试图打开自己汽车的车门的话，那可能就要另当别论了。	He would need to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car that he was trying to break into.
磁共振成像依据的是一种叫核磁共振 (NMR) 的物理现象，它是费利克斯·布洛赫（在斯坦福大学工作）和爱德华·珀塞耳（来自哈佛大学）于 20 世纪 30 年代发现的。	MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
在这种共振中，磁场和无线电波导致原子发出微弱的无线电信号。	In this resonance, magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to give off tiny radio signals.
1970 年，医学博士兼研究科学家雷蒙德·达马迪安 (Raymond Damadian) 发现了使用磁共振成像作为医学诊断工具的基础原理。	In the year 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and research scientist, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
四年后，一项专利获批准，这是世界上首个颁发的核磁共振领域专利。	Four years later a patent was granted, which was the world's first patent issued in the field of MRI.
1977 年，达马迪安（Damadian）博士完成了第一台 “全身” 核磁共振扫描仪的制造，他称之为 “不屈号”。	In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first “whole-body” MRI scanner, which he called the ”Indomitable”.
神经生物学数据为认知研究的理论方法提供了物理证据。因此，它缩小了研究范围，并使研究更加精确。	Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore it narrows the research area and makes it much more exact.
大脑病理和行为之间的相关性可以为科学家们的研究提供支持。	The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
我们很早就知道，不同类型的脑损伤、创伤、病变和肿瘤会对人的行为产生影响，并导致某些心智功能发生变化。	It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
新技术的兴起让我们能够看到和研究大脑的结构和工作过程，这些是以前从未见过的。	The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
这为我们建立仿真模型提供了大量的信息和材料，有助于我们理解大脑运作的过程。	This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us to understand processes in our mind.
人工智能有很强的科幻色彩，但它其实是计算机科学非常重要的一个分支，研究的是机器的行为、学习和智能适应。	Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
人工智能 (AI) 的研究涉及制造机器让需要智能行为的任务自动化。	Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
例子包括控制、规划和调度，回应客户诊断及客户问题的能力，还有手写识别，声音和脸部功能。	Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
所有的这些都成为了独立的学科，着重为现实生活中的问题提供解决方案。	Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
人工智能系统现在经常用于经济、医学、工程学和军事领域，有些家用计算机和电子游戏软件应用程序已经有内置的人工智能系统。	The AI ​​system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as has been built in several home computer and video game software applications.
