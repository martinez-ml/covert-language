每个人都是社会的一份子，都会使用交通系统。而几乎每个人都对交通系统有怨言。	Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
在发达国家，你甚少会听到关于水质或桥梁倒塌类似程度的投诉。	In developed countries you seldom hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down.
为什么交通系统会引起这样的投诉？为什么它们每天都会出故障？是交通工程师不称职吗？或者是有更根本的原因？	Why do transportation systems engender such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
交通流量研究的是驾驶员和车辆在两点之间的运动，以及它们之间的相互作用。	Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with one another.
遗憾的是，研究车流很困难，因为不能对驾驶员的行为进行百分之百确定的预测。	Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one-hundred percent certainty.
幸运的是，司机的行为往往在一个合理的一致性范围内；因此，交通流量往往具有一定的合理一致性，可以粗略地用数学方式表示。	Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
为了更好地表示交通流量，在以下三个主要特征之间建立了关系：(1) 流量、(2) 密度和 (3) 速度。	To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
这些关系对道路设施的规划、设计和运营有帮助。	These relationships help in planning, design, and operations of roadway facilities.
