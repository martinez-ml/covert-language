MySpace 是美国第三大最受欢迎的网站，目前有 5,400 万个注册帐号。	MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and has 54 million profiles currently.
这些网站得到了很多关注，尤其是在教育领域。	These websites have gotten a lot of attention, especially in the education setting.
这些网站也有好处，比如可以轻松创建一个包含博客、视频、照片等内容的班级页面。	There are positive aspects to these websites, which include, being able to easily setup a class page which can include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
只需提供一个网址，就能轻松访问该页面。这对不会用键盘或拼写有困难的学生来说，更加容易记住，输入也更简单。	This page can easily be accessed by providing just one web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to type in for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling.

“注意力缺失症“是一种神经系统综合症，三种典型的限定症状包括冲动、注意力分散、多动或精力过剩。	Attention Deficit Disorder "is a neurological syndrome whose classic defining triad of symptoms including impulsivity, distractibility, and hyperactivity or excess energy".
这不是学习能力缺失，而是学习障碍；这“影响着全美儿童的 3% 到 5%，人数可能多达 200 万”。	It is not a learning disability, it is a learning disorder; it "affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children".
患有多动症的孩子很难专心做事，例如做作业，但他们能够集中精力做自己喜欢的事情，比如玩游戏，看喜欢的卡通片，或者写一些不加标点符号的句子。	Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like school work, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy doing like playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
这些孩子往往会陷入很多麻烦。因为正常的方法无法刺激他们的大脑，为了刺激大脑，他们“做出危险行为、打架、挑战权威”。	These children tend to get into a lot of trouble, because they "engage in risky behaviors, get into fights, and challenge authority" in order to stimulate their brain, since their brain can not be stimulated by normal methods.
注意力缺陷障碍（ADD）会影响患病孩童与其同龄人的关系，因为其他儿童无法理解患者做出行为、进行拼写的原因所在，也不理解为什么他们的成熟程度与众不同。	ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children can not understand why they act the way that they do or why they spell they way they do or that their maturity level is different.
看到这种活动，殖民者也要求了增援。	The Colonists, seeing this activity, had also called for reinforcements.
支援前沿阵地的部队包括 200 人的新罕布什尔第 1 团和第 3 团，由约翰·斯塔克上校和詹姆斯·里德上校（后来都成为了将军）指挥。	Troops reinforcing the forward positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 men, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
斯塔克(Stark) 的士兵沿着殖民者阵地北端的防御围栏站位。	Stark's men took positions along the fence on the north end of the Colonist's position.
退潮时，沿半岛东北部流淌的神秘河打开了一道缺口，他们迅速建起一堵短石墙，把围墙延伸到岸边北端的小海滩上。	When low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north ending at the water's edge on a small beach.
格里德利（Gridley）或斯塔克（Stark ）在栅栏前 100 英尺（ 30 米）处放置一根木桩，并命令在正规军经过前不许开火。	Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the regulars passed it.
美国计划从三个不同的方向发动协同攻击。	The American plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three different directions.
约翰·卡德瓦德将军将向波登镇的英国守军发动一场进攻，转移敌方注意力，以阻挡任何增援部队。	General John Cadwalder would launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown, in order to block off any reinforcements.

2400 人的主力部队将在特伦顿 (Trenton) 以北 9 英里处渡河，然后分成两组，一组由格林 (Greene) 指挥，一组由沙利文 (Sullivan) 指挥，以便在黎明前发动进攻。	The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, in order to launch a pre-dawn attack.
虽然项目学习法应该使学习变得更容易、更有趣，但支架式学习法却更进一步。	While project based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond.
支架式教学不是一种学习方法，而是一种辅助刚学习使用新电脑程序或启动新项目的人的手段。	Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals whom are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or beginning a new project.
支架式教学可以线上或线下进行，换句话说，老师是支架式教学的一种形式，就像 Microsoft Office 里的回形针小助手一样。	Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
虚拟支持内化在软件中，用来质疑、提示和解释那些可能对学生来说难以独自处理的程序。	Virtual Scaffolds are internalized in the software and are meant to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been to challenging for the student to handle alone.
孩子们因为各种原因被寄养，原因有被忽视、被虐待，甚至是被勒索。	Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons that range from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.
任何孩子都不应该在一个没有教养、没有关爱、没有教育的环境中成长，但事与愿违。	No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
我们认为寄养系统对这些孩子来说是一个安全地带。	We perceive the Foster Care System to be a safety zone for these children.
我们的寄养系统应该提供安全的家、有爱心的看护者、稳定的教育和可靠的医疗。	Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
寄养体系应该提供一切其原生家庭所缺乏的必需品。	Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they were previously taken from.
由议长约翰·汉考克和秘书长查尔斯·汤姆逊签署的手写草案在7月4日得到大陆议会批准，之后被送到几个街区以外的约翰·邓拉普印刷厂付印。	After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
一夜之间印刷了 150 到 200 份，就是现在众所周知的“邓拉普宽边”(Dunlap broadsides) 版。	Through the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
7 月 8 日，约翰·尼克松 (John Nixon) 在独立大厅的院子里首次公开宣读了这份文件。	The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
其中一封于 7 月 6 日寄给了乔治·华盛顿，华盛顿于 7 月 9 日在纽约向他的军队宣读了这封信。一份副本于 8 月 10 日抵达伦敦。	One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
