有个传统是在复活节之夜在户外某处醒着看日出。	There's a tradition to pass the Easter night awake at some exposed point to see the sunrise.

更传统的教堂常常在复活节周末的周六晚上举行复活节守夜活动，会众通常在午夜钟声敲响之时涌入庆典，庆祝基督的复活。	More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the congregations often breaking into celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
