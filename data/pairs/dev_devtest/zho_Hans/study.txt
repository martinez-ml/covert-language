尽管短期访问某些国家时，旅游或商务出行并不需要签证，但留学生去那里的话，所待的时间通常需比休闲的游客要长。	While you may not need a visa for short visits to certain countries as a tourist or for business, going there as an international student generally requires a longer stay than going there just as a casual tourist.
通常来说，较长时间停留在外国需要提前获取签证。	In general, staying in any foreign country for an extended period of time will require you to obtain a visa in advance.
与普通旅游签证或商务签证相比，学生签证通常有不同的要求和申请程序。	Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures from normal tourist or business visas.
在大多数国家，你需要一份你希望就读的学校的录取通知书，以及证明你有至少第一年课程所需资金的文件。	For most countries, you will need an offer letter from the institution you wish to study at, and also evidence of funds to support yourself for at least the first year of your course.
咨询学校及你希望留学的国家的移民局，以了解详细要求。	Check with the institution, as well as the immigration department for the country you wish to study in for detailed requirements.
