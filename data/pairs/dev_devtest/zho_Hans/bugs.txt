昆虫是最早在空中飞行的动物。飞行能力让它们更容易躲避敌人，更有效地寻找食物和配偶。	Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
大多数昆虫都具有一种优势，可以将翅膀沿身体向后折叠。	Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
这让它们有了更多小面积空间来躲避捕食者。	This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
如今，唯一不能向后折叠翅膀的昆虫是蜻蜓和蜉蝣。	Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragon flies and mayflies.
