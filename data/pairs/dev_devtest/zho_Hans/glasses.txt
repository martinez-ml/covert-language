眼镜在国外可能更便宜，特别是在低收入国家，那里的劳动力成本更加低廉。	Eyeglasses can be cheaper in a foreign country, especially in low-income countries where labour costs are lower.
可以考虑在本国做眼部检查（尤其是医保可以报销的情况下），然后将处方拿到其他地方去配镜。	Consider getting an eye exam at home, especially if insurance covers it, and bringing the prescription along to be filed elsewhere.
在这些地区买到的高端品牌镜架可能存在两个问题：有些可能是山寨货，而且正品进口镜架可能比在国内购买要贵。	High-end brand-name frames available in such areas may have two problems; some may be knock-offs, and the real imported ones may be more expensive than at home.
