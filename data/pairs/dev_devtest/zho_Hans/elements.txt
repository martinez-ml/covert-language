恒星会散发光和热，这是因为氢原子结合（或聚变）在一起形成更重的元素时产生了能量。	Stars give off light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen atoms are merged (or fused) together to form heavier elements.
科学家目前致力打造一种可通过相同的方式产生能量的反应堆。	Scientists are working to create a reactor that can make energy in the same way.
然而，这是一个很难解决的问题。需要很多年的时间，我们才能看到实用的聚变反应堆建成。	This, however, is a very hard problem to solve and will take many years before we see useful fusion reactors built.
黄金可以加工成各种形状。可以卷曲成微小的形状。	Gold may be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
它可以拉成细丝，用于缠绕和编结。也可以捶打或碾成片状。	It can be pulled into thin wire, which can be twisted and plaited. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
它可以做得很薄，粘在其他金属上，由于达到如此之薄，有时可以用于装饰被称为“彩饰手抄本”的书本里的手绘图画。	It can be made very thin, and stuck onto other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
