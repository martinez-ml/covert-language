迄今为止，船运是跨洋运输大量人员和货物的最有效方式。	Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
从传统意义上讲，海军的任务是确保国家保持运输人员和货物的能力，同时，干扰敌人运输其人员和货物的能力。	The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
一个最值得注意的现代的例子就是二战期间的北大西洋战役。美国人尝试横跨大西洋运送人员和物资来帮助英国。	One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
与此同时，以 U 型潜艇为主力的德国海军试图拦截这场运输。	At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
假如同盟国当时失败了，德国原本很可能像征服欧洲其他国家一样征服英国。	Had the Allies failed, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
