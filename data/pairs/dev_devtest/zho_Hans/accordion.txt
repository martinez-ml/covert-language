确保你的手尽可能地放松，同时仍可以正确地敲击所有的音符—手指也尽量不要做太多无关的动作。	Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the notes correctly - also try not to make much extraneous motion with your fingers.
这样就能让你尽可能节省体力。记住，不用像在钢琴上那样用力敲击琴键来提升音量。	This way, you will tire yourself out as little as possible. Remember there's no need to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume like on the piano.
为了提高手风琴的音量，可以更用力或以更快的速度拉风箱。	On the accordion, to get extra volume, you use the bellows with more pressure or speed.
