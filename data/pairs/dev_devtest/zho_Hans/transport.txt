已知的第一种交通方式是步行。200 万年前，随着直立人（Homo Erectus，意思是直立的人）的出现，人类开始直立行走。	The first known transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
他们的祖先南方古猿没有直立行走的习惯。	Their predecessors, the Australopithecus did not walk upright as habitually.
人们在 420 万至 390 万年前的南方古猿化石中发现了双足特化的现象，尽管乍得沙赫人（Sahelanthropus）可能早在 700 万年前就已经用双腿行走了。	Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
