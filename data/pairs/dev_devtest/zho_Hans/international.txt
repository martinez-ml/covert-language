联合国维和人员在 2010 年地震后抵达海地，他们因疫情蔓延而受到指责。疫情是从部队营地附近开始扩散的。	UN peacekeepers, whom arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, are being blamed for the spread of the disease which started near the troop's encampment.
诉讼材料显示，联合国营地未能对废弃物进行适当的消毒处理，因而导致细菌进入阿蒂博尼特河的支流，这是海地最大河流之一。	According to the lawsuit, waste from the UN camp was not properly sanitized, causing bacteria to enter the tributary of the Artibonite River, one of Haiti's largest.
在军队到来之前，海地自 19 世纪初以来从未遇到过与该疾病有关的问题。	Prior to the arrival of troops, Haiti had not encountered problems related to the disease since the 1800s.
海地正义与民主研究所 (Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy) 引用的独立研究表明，是尼泊尔的联合国维和部队在不知情的情况下将这种疾病带到了海地。	The Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy has referenced independent studies that suggest the Nepalese UN peacekeeping battalion unknowingly brought the disease to Haiti.
研究该疾病的联合国专家丹妮尔·拉塔涅 (Danielle Lantagne) 表示，疫情爆发很可能是由维和人员引起的。	Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on the disease, stated the outbreak was likely caused by the peacekeepers.
