这座传统的中世纪城堡长久以来一直激发着人们的想象力，让人联想到马背长矛比武、宴会和亚瑟王骑士精神的画面。	The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, conjuring up images of jousts, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.
人们即使站在千年的废墟中，也很容易回想起早已逝去的战争的声音和气味，几乎能听到鹅卵石上马蹄的碰撞声，也能闻到从地牢坑里冒出来的恐惧气息。	Even standing amidst thousand year-old ruins it is easy to bring to mind the sounds and smells of battles long gone, to almost hear the clatter of hooves on the cobbles and to smell the fear rising from the dungeon pits.
