许多古生物学家相信有一群恐龙存活了下来，并一直存活至今，也就是我们所称的“鸟类”。	Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
很多人认为它们并非恐龙，因为它们有羽毛，会飞。	Many people don't think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
但鸟类还是有很多地方跟恐龙相似。	But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
它们脚上有鳞片和爪子，会产卵，还像霸王龙一样用两条后腿走路。	They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
