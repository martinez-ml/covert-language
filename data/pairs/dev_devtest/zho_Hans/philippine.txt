美帝国主义在征服菲律宾时的战争开支是由菲律宾人民自己支付的。	The war expenditures of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
他们被迫向美国殖民政权纳税，用于支付大部分开支，以及通过华尔街银行以菲律宾政府名义发行的债券的利息。	They were compelled to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to defray a major part of the expenditures and the interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
当然，长期剥削菲律宾人民所获得的高额利润成为美帝国主义的基本收益。	Of course, the superprofits derived from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
