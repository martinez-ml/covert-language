多年来，人们使用过很多不同的胶片格式。标准 35mm 胶片（36x24mm 底片）是最常见的。	There are many different film formats that have been used over the years. Standard 35 mm film (36 by 24 mm negative) is much the commonest.
如果用完了胶片，通常可以很轻易地补货，所呈现的分辨率大致与当前的数码单反相机无差。	It can usually be replenished fairly easily if you run out, and gives resolution roughly comparable to a current DSLR.
一些中画幅胶片相机使用 6x6cm 的画幅，更准确地说，是 56x56mm 的底片。	Some medium-format film cameras use a 6 by 6 cm format, more precisely a 56 by 56 mm negative.
这样一来，分辨率几乎达到了 35 mm 底片（3136 mm2 对 864）的四倍。	This gives resolution almost four times that of a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 versus 864).
有关常规摄影的规则也适用于录像，甚至可能更适用。	Rules regarding regular photography also apply to video recording, possibly even more so.
如果连拍照都不允许的话，就更不用想拍摄视频了。	If just taking a photo of something isn't allowed, then you shouldn't even think of recording a video of it.
如果使用无人机，请提前仔细确认可以拍摄的内容，以及需要哪些许可或额外的牌照。	If using a drone, check well in advance as to what you are allowed to film and what permits or additional licensing are required.
在机场附近或人群拥挤的地方操控无人机升空，是个馊主意，即使这在你所在地区并不违法。	Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.
