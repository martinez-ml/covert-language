现代溜冰鞋的刀刃是双刃的，刃与刃之间有一个凹洞。双刃对冰有更好的抓力（即使是在倾斜的时候）。	The blade on a modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave hollow between them. The two edges allow for a better grasp of the ice, even when tilted.
由于刀片的底部略弯曲，当刀片歪向其中一侧时，与冰接触的刀边弯曲了。	Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, as the blade tilts to one side or the other, the edge which is in contact with the ice also curves.
这样一来，溜冰者就可以转弯。冰刀向右倾斜，溜冰者就转向右边。冰刀向左倾斜，溜冰者就转向左边。	This causes the skater to turn. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns left.
它们必须消除从光中得到的多余能量。，才能恢复到之前的能量等级。	To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they got from the light.
它们是通过发射一种被称为“光子”的微小光粒子做到这一点的。	They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a "photon".
科学家把这一过程称为“受激辐射”，因为原子受到强光的刺激，引起光子的发射，而光也是辐射的一种。	Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, causing the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.
下一张图片显示的是原子发射光子的情况。当然，实际上光子要比图片上的样子小得多。	The next picture shows the atoms emitting photons. Of course, in reality photons are a lot smaller than those in the picture.
光子甚至比构成原子的物质还要小！	Photons are even smaller than the stuff that makes up atoms!
使用几百个小时后，灯丝最终被烧坏，而灯泡也不亮了。	After hundreds of hours of operation the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works.
然后需要更换灯泡。更换灯泡时必须小心操作。	The light bulb then needs replacing. It is necessary to be careful in replacing the light bulb.
首先，务必关闭照明灯具的开关或断开电缆连接。	First, the switch for the light fixture needs to be turned off or the cable disconnected.
这是因为，当灯泡还有一部分与插座相连时，当你接触到插座内部或灯泡的金属底座时，电流会流入插座（灯泡金属底座的连接处），让你受到严重的电击。	This is because electricity flowing into the socket where the metallic part of bulb sits can give you a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partly in the socket.
时间就在我们身边，影响着我们做的每一件事，但却很难理解。	Time is something that is all around us, and affects everything we do, yet is difficult to understand.
数千年来，时间一直是宗教、哲学和科学学者的研究对象。	Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
我们所经历的时间是一系列从未来到现在再到过去的事件。	We experience time as a series of events passing from the future through the present to the past.
时间也是我们用来比较事件持续时间（长度）的方式。	Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events.
你可以通过观察重复的周期性事件来记录时间的流逝。周期性事件是指有规律地一次又一次发生的事。	You can mark the passing of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens again and again regularly.
今天，我们使用计算机处理图片和视频。	Computers today are used to manipulate pictures and videos.
复杂的动画可以在计算机上构建，这种类型的动画正越来越多地应用于电视和电影。	Sophisticated animations can be constructed on computers, and this kind of animation is increasingly being used in television and films.
录制音乐时往往用复杂的计算机来处理，并把声音混合在一起。	Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds together.
哈拉帕 (Harappa) 和摩亨佐-达罗 (Mohenjo-daro) 这两个城市几乎每家每户都有抽水马桶，这些马桶与精密的污水处理系统相连。	The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
在希腊克里特岛和圣托里尼米诺斯城市的房屋中发现了污水系统的遗迹。	Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
古埃及、波斯和中国也有厕所。在罗马文明中，厕所有时是男女混合的公共浴室的一部分。	There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women were together in mixed company.
你给远在千里之外的人打电话，就会用到卫星。	When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
太空中的卫星接到电话后，几乎是立刻将其反射回去。	The satellite in space gets the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
卫星是由火箭发射到太空的。科学家在太空中使用望远镜是因为地球的大气层让某些光线和视野产生扭曲。	The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth’s atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
要把卫星或望远镜送入太空，需要一枚超过 100 英尺高的巨型火箭。	It takes a giant rocket over a 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
车轮以不可思议的方式改变了世界。车轮对我们最大的贡献，是让我们的交通更加便捷。	The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is given us much easier and faster transportation.
有了它，我们才有了火车、汽车和许多其他交通工具。	It has brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
“上弓”符号像字母 V，“下弓”符号像是钉书钉或是缺少了底边的正方形。	The "up bow" mark looks like a V and the "down bow mark" like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
向上指的是从顶端开始推弓，向下指的是从弓根处（也就是手握弓的地方）开始拉弓。	Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
上弓通常会发出更加柔和的声音，而下弓则会发出更强烈、更为坚定的声响。	An up-bow usually generates a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
请随意用铅笔作上你自己的标记，但要记住，印出来的音符是具有音乐意义的，所以它们通常应该被尊重。	Feel free to pencil in your own marks, but remember the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
因此，铅笔一问世，就成了许多人的心头好。	Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
遗憾的是，随着新的书写方式的出现，铅笔的地位越来越低，使用也越来越少。	Sadly, as newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to lesser status and uses.
人们现在在电脑屏幕上写信息，永远不必接触卷笔刀了。	People now write messages on computer screens, never having to come close to a sharpener.
人们只能猜测，当更新的产品出现时，键盘的结局会是怎样。	One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
裂变原子弹的工作原理如下：把一个原子核和许多质子及中子聚在一起需要能量。	The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
有点像推着一辆笨重的小推车上山。再次分裂原子核，然后释放一些能量。	Sort of like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus up again then releases some of that energy.
有些原子含有不稳定的原子核，这意味着它们很可能会在很少或没有刺激的情况下发生分裂。	Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to break apart with little or no nudging.
