当获取知识和进行学习的能力发生如上所述的变化时，获取知识的基本速率也相应地产生变化。	As the ability to obtain knowledge and to learn changed in such a way as mentioned above the base rate at which knowledge was obtained changed.
获取信息的方法不尽相同。压力不再存在于个人回忆中，但回忆文本的能力变得更加重要。	The approach to obtaining information was different. No longer did pressure reside within individual recall, but the ability to recall text became more of a focus.
文艺复兴从根本上让学习和知识传播的方式产生了重大变化。	In essence, the Renaissance made a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
媒体公司照例撒谎以掩盖其目的，声称这是为了“防止盗版”。	The media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this, claiming that it is to "prevent piracy".
事实上，区域码对非法复制毫无影响；一份逐位拷贝的磁盘副本在任何可以播放原盘的设备上都可以顺利播放。	In fact, region codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying; a bit-for-bit copy of a disk will play just fine on any device where the original will.
实际上的目的是为了让这些公司更好地控制他们的市场；一切都是为了圈钱。	The actual purpose is to give those companies more control over their markets; it's all about money spinning.
因为呼叫是通过互联网路由的，因此你不必使用位于你居住地或旅行地点的通话公司。	Because calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use a phone company located where you live or where you travel.
是否在居住的社区获得本地号码，这点没有要求；你可以在阿拉斯加奇金的野外获得卫星互联网连接，然后选一个号码，显示你位于阳光明媚的亚利桑那州。	There is also no requirement that you obtain a local number from the community in which you live; you can obtain a satellite Internet connection in the wilds of Chicken, Alaska and select a number which claims you're in sunny Arizona.
很多时候，你必须单独购买一个可以在全球使用的号码，这样才能接听来自公共交换电话网 (PSTN) 电话的呼叫。该号码的来源地对主叫方有很大影响。	Often, you have to buy a global number separately that allows PSTN phones to call you. Where the number is from makes a difference for people calling you.
实时文本翻译应用：能够自动将整段文本从一种语言转换成另一种语言的应用程序。	Real-time text translator apps – applications that are capable of automatically translating whole segments of text from one language into another.
某些此类应用程序甚至让用户把智能手机对着现实世界中的标志或其他物体，就能翻译上面的外语文字。	Some of the applications in this category can even translate texts in foreign languages on signs or other objects in the real world when the user points the smartphone towards those objects.
翻译引擎有了显著的改进，现在经常提供或多或少正确的翻译（而更多情况是很少有胡言乱语），但需要注意的是，他们仍然可能会完全翻错。	The translation engines have improved dramatically, and now often give more or less correct translations (and more seldom gibberish), but some care is due, as they still may have gotten it all wrong.
一个最杰出的此类应用是谷歌翻译。在下载所需语言数据后，它可以进行离线翻译。	One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the desired language data.
出国旅行时，使用智能手机 GPS 导航应用可能是最简单方便的导航方式。	Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when out of your home country.
比起够买带 GPS 的地图或独立的 GPS 设备，或者是从汽车租赁公司租一个，这种方式更省钱。	It can save money over buying new maps for a GPS, or a standalone GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
如果你的手机没有数据连接，或者不在服务范围，手机的性能可能会受限，或者无法使用手机。	If you don't have a data connection for your phone, or when it is out of range, their performance can be limited or unavailable.
每个街头小店都摆满了一排令人眼花缭乱的预付费电话卡，这些电话卡既可以用于公用付费电话机，也可以用于普通电话机。	Every corner store is filled with a confusing array of pre-paid phone cards that can be used from pay phones or ordinary telephones.
尽管大多数电话卡适合给任何地方打电话，但有些卡在拨打一些特定国家的电话时有特别优惠。	While most cards are good for calling anywhere, some specialise in providing favourable call rates to specific groups of countries.
通常拨打一个电话号码即可获取这些服务，而大多数的电话都可免费拨打该串号码。	Access to these services is often through a toll-free telephone number that can be called from most phones without charge.
互联网结合了大众传播和人际传播的要素。	The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
互联网的鲜明特点使其在用途和满足方式方面增添了额外的维度。	The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
例如，“学习”和“交际”被认为是使用互联网的重要动机（詹姆斯等，1995）。	For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
在研究受众对网站的反应时，艾麦和麦克德（1998 年）把“个人参与”和“持续的关系”也作为新的动机因素。	“Personal involvement” and “continuing relationships” were also identified as new motivation aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
录像的使用为阐释微表情（持续几毫秒的面部运动）带来了重大发现。	The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements which last a few milliseconds.
具体说来，据说可以通过正确解读微表情来判断一个人是否在撒谎。	In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
奥利弗·萨克斯 (Oliver Sacks) 在他的论文《总统的演讲》中指出，那些因为脑损伤而无法理解语言的人仍然能够准确地判断说话人是否有诚意。	Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
他甚至提出，这种理解人类行为的能力可能是家犬等动物共有的本领。	He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
在手机信号覆盖不到的偏远地区，卫星电话可能是你的唯一选择。	In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
一般来说，卫星电话不能取代移动电话，因为只有在卫星信号畅通的室外，才能进行通话。	A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors with clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
该服务经常用于航运，包括游艇以及有远程数据和语音需求的探险。	The service is frequently used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions who have remote data and voice needs.
你当地的电话服务提供商应该能够提供关于连接到这项服务的详细信息。	Your local telephone service provider should be able to give more information about connecting to this service.
