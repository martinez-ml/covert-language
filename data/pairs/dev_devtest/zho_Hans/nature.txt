1963 年大坝建成后，季节性洪水被控制住了，沉积物不再冲散到河流里。	After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods that would spread sediment throughout the river were halted.
这种沉积物是形成沙洲和海滩的必要条件，而沙洲和海滩是野生动物的栖息地。	This sediment was necessary for creating sandbars and beaches, which served as wildlife habitats.
结果，两种鱼类灭绝，另外两种鱼类濒临灭绝，其中包括弓背鲑。	As a result, two fish species have become extinct, and two others have become endangered, including the humpback chub.
虽然在洪水过后，水位只会上升几英尺，但官员们希望这足以恢复下游被侵蚀的沙洲。	Although the water level will only rise a few feet after the flood, officials are hoping it will be enough to restore eroded sandbars downstream.
目前还没有发布海啸预警。根据雅加达地质局的说法，由于此次地震没有达到 6.5 级，因此不会发布海啸预警。	No tsunami warning has been issued, and according to the Jakarta geophysics agency, no tsunami warning will be issued because the quake did not meet the magnitude 6.5 requirement.
尽管那里没有海啸的威胁，当地居民却感到坐立不安，纷纷结束生意及离开家园。	Despite there being no tsunami threat, residents started to panic and began to leave their businesses and homes.
