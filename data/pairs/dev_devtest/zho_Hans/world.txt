对法作战结束后，德国又开始为入侵不列颠岛做准备。	With the battle for France over, Germany began to get ready to invade the island of Britain.
德国将此次袭击的代号定为“海狮行动”。英国军队从敦刻尔克撤退时失去了大部分重型武器和补给，元气大伤。	Germany code-named the attack “Operation Sealion”. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was fairly weak.
但皇家海军还是比德国海军（“Kriegsmarine”）强得多，可以摧毁任何跨越英吉利海峡的入侵舰队。	But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
然而，很少有皇家海军舰艇在潜在的入侵路线附近驻扎，因为海军将领们担心舰艇会被德国的空袭击沉。	However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attack.
让我们先来解释一下意大利的计划。意大利基本上属于德国和日本的“小兄弟”。	Let's start with an explanation about Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
该国陆军和海军都比较弱，尽管他们在战争开始前不久建造了四艘新舰船。	It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they had just built four new ships right before the beginning of the war.
意大利的主要目标是非洲国家。为了夺取这些国家，他们需要一个军队基地，以便军队可以驶穿地中海，入侵非洲。	Italy's main goals were African countries. To capture those countries, they would need to have a troop launching pad, so as troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
为此，他们不得不将英国在埃及的基地和船舰撤出。除了采取这些行动，意大利的战舰本不应该有所行动。	For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides those actions, Italy's battleships were not supposed to do anything else.
现在来看日本。和英国一样，日本是一个岛国。	Now for Japan. Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
潜水艇是为了在水底下行驶而设计的船，而且潜水艇在水面下停留的时间较长。	Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater, and remain there for an extended amount of time.
第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战期间都使用了潜水艇。 那时它们的速度很慢，射击范围也非常有限。	Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. Back then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.
在战争开始时，它们大多在海面上航行，但随着雷达的发展和精确度的提高，潜艇被迫潜入水下以免被发现。	In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.
德国潜艇被称为 U 型潜艇。德国人非常擅长导航和操作潜艇。	German submarines were called U-Boats. The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines.
由于德国人在潜艇方面很成功，他们在战后不获托管大量潜艇。	Because of their success with submarines, after the war Germans aren't trusted to have many of them.

每年 10 月前后，大约有 150 万只食草动物从北部山区出发，穿过马拉河，前往雨水充足的南部平原。	Every year around October nearly 1.5 million herbivores travel towards the southern plains, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills for the rains.
然后，在四月左右的雨季之后，从西部回到北部，再次穿越马拉河。	And then back to the north through the west, once again crossing the Mara river, after the rains in around April.
塞伦盖蒂（Serengeti）地区包括塞伦盖蒂（Serengeti ）国家公园、坦桑尼亚的恩戈罗恩戈罗（Ngorongoro）自然保护区、马斯瓦（Maswa）野生动物保护区以及肯尼亚的马赛马拉（Maasai Mara）国家保护区。	The Serengeti region contains the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
意大利人在北非的处境几乎从一开始就不甚理想。1940 年 6 月 10 日，意大利宣战后不到一周，英国第 11 轻骑兵就占领了利比亚的卡普佐堡。	Things did not go well for the Italians in North Africa almost from the start. Within a week of Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussars had seized Fort Capuzzo in Libya.

诺曼底登陆和随后的战斗解放了法国北部，但南部仍然没有解放。	The D-Day landings and the following battles had freed the north of France, but the south still wasn't free.
它由“维希”法国人统治。这些法国人在 1940 年与德国人达成了和平协议，不反抗侵略者，而是和他们合作。	It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
1940 年 8 月 15 日，盟军攻入法国南部，这次进攻被称为“龙骑兵行动”。	On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
仅仅两个星期，美国和自由法国的军队就解放了法国南部，并转向德国。	In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
马丘比丘古城由三座主要建筑物组成，分别是拴日石 (Intihuatana)、太阳神庙和三窗之屋。	Machu Picchu consist of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
为了让游客更好地了解建筑群的原貌，该建筑群边缘的大部分建筑都经过重建。	Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
到 1976 年，马丘比丘的百分之三十得到修复，修复工作一直持续到今天。	By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues till today.
到了 1939 年 9 月 17 日，波兰的防线已经被攻破，剩下的唯一希望就是沿着罗马尼亚桥头堡撤退和改编军队。	By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
然而，这些计划几乎在一夜之间被弃如敝履，在违反《里加和平条约》、《苏联波兰互不侵犯条约》及其他双边及多边国际条约，入侵波兰的东部地区之后，超过 80 万名苏联红军入境，并在白俄罗斯和乌克兰筑起阵地。	However, these plans were rendered obsolete nearly overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet's Union Red Army entered and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
尽管石制金字塔的建造一直持续到古王国末期，但吉萨金字塔的宏大的规模和高超的建造技术从未被超越。	Although pyramid-building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
