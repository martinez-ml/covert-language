共享资源管理员亚当·库尔登 (Adam Cuerden) 上个月在接受维基新闻 (Wikinews) 采访时表达了他对删除相关内容的不满。	Commons Administrator Adam Cuerden expressed his frustration over the deletions when he spoke to Wikinews last month.
“说穿了，他[威尔斯]从一开始就对我们撒谎。首先，他表现得好像是出于法律原因才这么做。其次，他先是假装听取我们的意见，然后直接删除了这些艺术作品。”	"He [Wales] basically lied to us from the start. First, by acting as if this was for legal reasons. Second, by pretending he was listening to us, right up to his art deletion."
由于民愤，目前正在针对该网站的性内容起草相关政策。该网站拥有数百万个获得公共传播许可的媒体。	The community irritation led to current efforts to draft a policy regarding sexual content for the site which hosts millions of openly-licensed media.
