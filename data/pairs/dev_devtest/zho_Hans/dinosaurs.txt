三角龙的牙齿不仅能咬碎树叶，还能咬碎非常坚硬的树枝和树根。	A triceratops' teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but even very tough branches and roots.
一些科学家认为，三角龙以苏铁为食，苏铁是白垩纪时期很常见的一种植物。	Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads, which are a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous.
这些植物看起来像一棵小棕榈树，树冠由钉子般的锋利叶子组成。	These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, spiky leaves.
在吃树干之前，三角龙会用它强有力的喙嘴剥去树叶。	A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to strip off the leaves before eating the trunk.
其他科学家认为这些植物有毒，所以恐龙不太可能吃它们，即便现在树懒和其他动物例如鹦鹉（恐龙的后代）可以吃有毒的叶子或水果。	Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, even though today the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
沧龙是那个时代的顶级掠食者，除了同类它什么都不怕。	Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
它的长下颚上布满了 70 多颗剃刀般锋利的牙齿，上颚上还有一排。这意味着任何与它相遇的东西都无路可逃。	Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
它的舌头有可能是分叉的，对此我们尚不确定。它的食物包括海龟、大型鱼类、其他沧龙，甚至会吃人。	We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
它会攻击任何进入水中的东西；即使像霸王龙之类的巨型恐龙也不是它的对手。	It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as T. rex would be no match for it.
