在尝试将电影转换成 DVD 格式时，最常见的问题之一是过度扫描。	One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is the overscan.
大多数电视节目都是为娱乐大众而制作的。	Most televisions are made in a way to please the general public.
出于该原因，你在电视上看到的画面边框，包括顶部、底部和侧边，都被裁剪了。	For that reason, everything you see on the TV had the borders cut, top, bottom and sides.
这样做是为了保证图像能覆盖住整个屏幕。这叫做“过度扫描”。	This is made to ensure that the image covers the whole screen. That is called overscan.
遗憾的是，当你制作 DVD 时，它的边框很可能也会被裁剪掉，而且如果视频中的字幕太靠近底部，那么字幕也会显示不完整。	Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, it's borders will most likely be cut too, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they won't be fully shown.
