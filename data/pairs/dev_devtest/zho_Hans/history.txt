穆罕默德对尘世生活之外的事十分感兴趣。他以前经常到“努尔”（光明）山上一个叫做”希拉“的山洞里去冥想。	Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as “Hira‘” on the Mountain of “Noor” (light) for contemplation.
该洞穴本身，不仅经受住时间考验而保留下来，还为穆罕默德的灵性意向带来极其生动的形象。	he cave itself, which survived the times, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
该洞穴坐落在麦加 (Mecca) 北部的一座山顶上，与外界完全隔绝。	Resting on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
事实上，即使知道它的存在，也不容易找到。一旦进入洞穴，就完全与世隔绝了。	In fact, it is not easy to find at all even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
除了清澈美丽的天空和周围的群山，什么也看不见。在洞穴中，几乎看不到也听不到外界的景象和声音。	Nothing can be seen other than the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
技术决定论是一个在实践中涵盖许多种思想的术语，包括技术推动论，技术必要论，以及一个严格的定义——人类命运是由与科学定律相关的背后逻辑及其在技术中的表现驱动的。	Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
大多数对技术决定论的解释都包括这两个总体思路：一是技术本身的发展在很大程度上超越了文化或政治影响，二是技术反过来会对社会产生不受社会条件制约的内在“影响”。	Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
例如，有人可能会说，汽车必然会促进道路的发展。	For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
然而，仅为少数汽车架设全国公路网，这在经济上并不可行，因此新的生产方式应运而生，以求降低汽车的拥有成本。	However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
大众汽车保有量较高还会导致更高的道路交通事故发生率，而这将推动发明用于修复伤者伤处的全新医疗技术。	Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
浪漫主义具有很强的文化决定论色彩。这源于歌德、费希特和施莱格尔等作家。	Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
在浪漫主义的背景下，地理塑造了个体，随着时间的推移，与地理相关的习俗和文化出现了，这些习俗文化因为与社会所处的地方和谐相融，要比任意强加的法律好得多。	In the context of Romanticism, the geography molded individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography arose, and these, being in harmony with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
英国早在 16 世纪就修建了货车道。	Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
虽然马拉轨道车只是由平行的木板拼成，但在当时，就略显坎坷的道路而言，这些车能让拉车的马跑得更快，拉得更多。	Although wagonways merely consisted of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day.
很早的时候就引进了轨枕，用于固定铁轨。但是，人们逐渐意识到，如果在铁轨上放上铁片，铁轨会更稳固有效。	Crossties were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a stip of iron on the top.
这成了普遍做法，但铁片会使木制的马车轮子磨损更严重。	This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
最终，木轮被铁轮所取代。1767 年，第一条全铁轨道问世。	Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-iron rails were introduced.
