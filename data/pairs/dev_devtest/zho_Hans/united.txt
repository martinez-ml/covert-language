如果你看过电影《国家宝藏》，你可能会以为《独立宣言》背面会画着一份藏宝图。	If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you may think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
然而事实并非如此。虽然这份文件的背面写了一些东西，但并是不一份藏宝图。	However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
《独立宣言》背面写着“Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776（《独立宣言》原件，1776 年 7 月 4 日）”的字样。文字写在文件底部，是倒过来的。	Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears on the bottom of the document, upside down.
虽然没有人能确定作者是谁，但这个大型羊皮纸文档（尺寸为 29¾ 英寸乘以 24½ 英寸）据称在刚写成的时候是卷起来存放的。	While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
因此，很可能这个符号只是作为一个标签添加的。	So, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
在独立战争期间，十三个州最初根据《联邦条例》组成了弱小的中央政府（国会是其唯一的组成部分）。	During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
国会没有征税的权力，而且因为没有国家行政部门或司法部门，国会只能依赖州政府执行所有法案，而州政府又经常不配合。	Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
它也没有权力推翻各州之间的税法和关税。	It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
这些条款必须得到所有州的一致同意才能进行修改，而各州对待中央政府的态度十分轻慢，以至于其州立代表经常缺席。	The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
