公元前 356 年 7 月 21 日，赫洛斯塔图斯 (Herostratus) 的纵火行为导致位于以弗所 (Ephesus) 的阿尔忒弥斯神庙毁于一旦。	The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BCE in an act of arson committed by Herostratus.
据故事情节所写，此人愿不惜一切代价出人头地。愤慨的以弗所人宣布黑若斯达特斯（Herostratus）之名罄竹难书。	According to the story, his motivation was fame at any cost. The Ephesians, outraged, announced that Herostratus' name never be recorded.
希腊历史学家斯特拉博 (Strabo) 后来提到了这个名字，也就是我们今天所熟知的名字。圣殿在亚历山大大帝出生的当晚被毁。	The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, which is how we know today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
亚历山大大帝原本提议重建这座神庙，但其提案遭到拒绝。随后，在亚历山大死后，该神庙于公元前 323 年得以重建。	Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was denied. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.
吉萨大金字塔是七大奇迹中唯一至今仍屹立不倒的建筑。	The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
大金字塔是埃及人在公元前三世纪的杰作，它是众多向已故法老表示敬意的大型金字塔的其中之一。	Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead Pharaoh.
埃及死亡之谷的吉萨（Giza）高原（即“吉萨金字塔群”）包括多个金字塔（其中大金字塔是最大的）、几个小坟墓，几个寺庙和大狮身人面像。	The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
大金字塔是为纪念胡夫法老而建造的，并为纪念胡夫的妻子和家庭成员建造了多座较小的金字塔、坟墓和庙宇。	The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
