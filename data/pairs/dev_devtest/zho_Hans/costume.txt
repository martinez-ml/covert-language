正如巴黎被称为当代世界的时尚之都一样，君士坦丁堡被认为是欧洲封建时代的时尚之都。	In the manner that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
它作为奢侈品中心的声誉始于公元 400 年左右，一直延续到公元 1100 年左右。	Its renown for being an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 A.D. and lasted up until about 1100 A.D.
它的地位在十二世纪下降，主要是因为十字军返回时带的礼物，如丝绸和香料等，比拜占庭市场提供的更有价值。	Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that Crusaders had returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were valued more than what Byzantine markets offered.
正是在这个时候，时尚之都的称号从君士坦丁堡转移到了巴黎。	It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
哥特式风格在 10 - 11 世纪到 14 世纪达到顶峰。	Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
起初，裙装深受东方拜占庭文化的影响。	At the beginning dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
然而，由于文化交流迟缓，西方的时尚可能落后 25 到 30 年。	However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 year.
随着中世纪走向末期，西欧人民逐渐发展出自己的风格。当时最大的进步之一就是十字军东征后，人们开始用纽扣来系衣服。	towards the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop their own style. one of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the crusades people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
