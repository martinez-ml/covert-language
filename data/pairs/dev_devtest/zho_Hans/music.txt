周一，瑞典学院诺贝尔文学委员会常务秘书萨拉·丹尼尔斯在瑞典广播电台的一档节目中向公众宣布，委员会因无法直接联系到鲍勃·迪伦，通知他获得了 2016 年诺贝尔文学奖，已经放弃了与他联系的尝试。	On Monday, Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy, publicly announced during a radio program on Sveriges Radio in Sweden the committee, unable to reach Bob Dylan directly about winning the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, had abandoned its efforts to reach him.
达尼厄斯说道：“目前我们保持按兵不动。我给他关系最好的合作者打过电话并发送了电子邮件，而且收到了对方非常友好的回复。就目前而言，这足够了。”	Danius said, "Right now we are doing nothing. I have called and sent emails to his closest collaborator and received very friendly replies. For now, that is certainly enough."
