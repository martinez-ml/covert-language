山羊似乎是 1 万年前左右在伊朗的扎格罗斯山脉首次被驯养的。	Goats seem to have been first domesticated roughly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
古代文明和部落开始驯养它们，食用和使用它们的奶、肉、毛和皮。	Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
家山羊通常被成群放牧在山上或其他牧区，它们通常由牧山羊人（大多为儿童或青少年）照管，牧山羊人与更广为人知的牧羊人类似。这些放牧方法至今仍在使用。	Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
