有些人认为，经常做人工诱导、清晰的梦会让人精疲力竭。	Some people believe that experiencing many artificially induced lucid dreams often enough can be very exhausting.
造成这种现象的主要原因是清晰的梦境延长了快速眼动状态之间的时间间隔。	The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of the lucid dreams expanding the length of time between REM states.
每晚快速眼动期 (REM) 越短，在这种状态下睡个好觉、恢复元气的频率就越少，身体可能会出问题。	With fewer REMs per night, this state in which you experience actual sleep and your body recovers becomes infrequent enough to become a problem.
这就像每隔二三十分钟就醒来看电视那样令人筋疲力竭。	This is just as exhausting as if you were to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
其效果取决于你的大脑每晚做清醒梦的频率。	The effect is dependent on how often your brain attempts to lucidly dream per night.
睡眠中断是指这样的过程：在正常睡眠期间有意地醒来，并且在短时间之后（10-60分钟）睡着。	Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10–60 minutes).
这很容易做到，使用相对安静的闹钟，让你在不被完全吵醒的情况下苏醒。	This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
如果你发现自己会在睡觉时重置闹钟，可以将闹钟放到房间的另一边，逼迫自己下床去关闹钟。	If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
其他基于生物节律的选择包括睡前大量饮用液体（尤其是水或茶——众所周知有利尿作用），强迫自己起来小便。	Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.
