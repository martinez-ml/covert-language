除非你是外交官，否则在海外工作一般需要向所在国家/地区缴纳所得税。	Unless you are a diplomat, working overseas generally means that you will have to file income tax in the country you are based in.
国家不同，所得税的结构是不同的，税率和税率等级也有很大的差异。	Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and the tax rates and brackets vary widely from one country to another.
一些联邦国家，比如美国和加拿大，会征收联邦和地方所得税，因此税率和等级可能因地区而异。	In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied both at the federal level and at the local level, so the rates and brackets can vary from region to region.
在旅行中进行志愿服务是一种与众不同的好方法，但这不仅仅在于付出。	Volunteering while travelling is a great way to make a difference but it's not just about giving.
在国外生活和做志愿者，是了解不同文化、结识新朋友、了解自我、锻炼正确判断的能力、甚至是获得新技能的好方法。	Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know a different culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, get a sense of perspective and even gain new skills.
这也是一个节省预算的好方法，可以在某处待更长时间，因为很多志愿者工作提供食宿，有些工作还有少量工资。	It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to allow a longer stay somewhere since many volunteer jobs provide room and board and a few pay a small salary.
对于那些计划怎么度过空档年的人来说，游学成为越来越受欢迎的选择。	An increasingly more popular option for those planning a gap-year is to travel and learn.
这在中学毕业生中尤其流行，他们可以在上大学前抽出一年的时间，又不影响他们接受教育。	This is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year out before university, without compromising their education.
很多情况下，在国外参加间隔年课程可以实质上提升你回国升学的机会。	In many cases, enrolling on a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of moving into higher education back in your home country.
通常情况下，参加这些教育类项目需要交学费。	Typically there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
