在十九世纪和二十世纪很长一段时间，人们都认为新西兰的第一批居民是毛利人，他们猎取一种称为恐鸟的大型鸟类。	For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people, who hunted giant birds called moas.
然后该理论确立了这样一种观点：毛利人从波利尼西亚乘“大船”迁移，并从莫里奥里人手中夺取了新西兰，建立了一个农业社会。	The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a Great Fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
但有新的证据表明，莫里奥里人属于大陆毛利人族群，他们从新西兰移居到查塔姆群岛，发展出了自己独特的崇尚和平的文化。	However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
查塔姆群岛上还有另一个部落，他们是从新西兰移民过来的毛利人。	There was also another tribe on the Chatham islands these were Maori who migrated away from New Zealand.
他们自称莫里奥里人。发生过一些小冲突，最后莫里奥里人被消灭了	They called themselves the Moriori there were a few skirmishes and in the end, the Moriori were wiped out
